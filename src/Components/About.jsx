              Hello!

            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Hi, Iâ€™m a passionate and dedicated front-end developer currently
              working at Varion Advisor Analytics. My expertise lies in creating
              intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces using modern
              tools and technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap. I
              enjoy crafting responsive and dynamic applications that provide
              seamless user experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              I have worked on a variety of projects, including food ordering
              platforms, dashboards, and a MERN-based chat application. I am
              skilled in integrating features such as authentication, real-time
              communication, and API handling into my projects.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              As someone who thrives in collaborative environments, I enjoy
              problem-solving and continuously improving my skills. I focus on
              writing clean, maintainable code and keeping up with the latest
              trends in web development.
            </p>
